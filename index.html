    <h1>MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY</h1>

    <p>My name is <strong>Rowena Marie T. Andrade</strong>, born on <strong>October 20, 2007</strong>, in the vibrant coastal city of <strong>Lapu-Lapu, Cebu, Philippines</strong>. I come from a place where the sky kisses the ocean and every street hums with stories. As the eldest of six siblings, I grew up balancing wonder with responsibility. My childhood was a colorful blend of chaos and care, filled with laughter, lessons, and love—memories I hold close to my heart.</p>

    <p>From an early age, I discovered the power of creativity. At Looc Elementary School, I found solace in drawing. It became my language when words fell short. I sketched characters and imagined worlds, letting my mind wander freely. Movies and games weren’t just entertainment—they were fuel for my imagination, shaping how I viewed life and possibility.</p>

    <p>Among my most cherished memories are those with my father. He had a quiet magic about him, lifting my spirits with small surprises and spontaneous adventures around Cebu. He taught me that love doesn’t always need grand gestures—it thrives in the little things, the thoughtful moments that linger. My father has since passed away, and though his absence is deeply felt, his love continues to guide me. I carry his lessons in my heart and strive to make him proud with every step I take.</p>

    <p>School has been a journey of growth. I’ve faced challenges—times when I doubted myself, struggled with subjects, or felt overwhelmed. But each obstacle taught me something valuable: how to be patient, how to ask for help, and how to keep going. I’ve had teachers who believed in me, classmates who became friends, and moments that shaped my confidence. Lapu-Lapu City is more than my birthplace—it’s my heartbeat. The festivals, the food, the language, the warmth of the people—all of it has shaped who I am. I’ve danced in local events, joined school programs, and felt the pride of being part of a community that celebrates life with color and spirit.</p>

    <p>Today, I’m a first-year student pursuing <strong>Computer Technology</strong>. This field excites me because it’s not just about machines—it’s about solving problems, building systems, and creating tools that make life better. I chose this path with my family in mind, hoping to one day build solutions that ease their burdens and improve our future. Technology, to me, is a bridge between dreams and reality.</p>

    <p>Outside of academics, dance holds a special place in my heart. I may not be the best dancer, but when the music plays, I move. Because dance, like life, isn’t about perfection—it’s about joy, freedom, and the courage to let go.</p>

    <p>I do not have a particular preference when it comes to food, as I enjoy a wide variety of dishes equally. However, I do favor refreshing beverages such as mango and avocado shakes, as well as pineapple juice. One of my personal habits includes watching films that evoke a range of emotions—whether they make me laugh, cry, or feel a sense of suspense. Although I am not professionally trained in dance or singing, I find great joy in both activities and engage in them whenever I can. Additionally, I often speak to myself, which helps me process my thoughts and reflect on my experiences. These small yet meaningful traits contribute to the person I am today.</p>

    <p>One day, I hope to travel—to see new places, meet new people, and learn from the world. I want to build apps that help others, maybe even start my own tech company. But more than anything, I want to be someone who lifts others up, who makes people feel seen and valued. I love mangoes, rainy afternoons, and watching Korean dramas. I hum songs even when I don’t know the lyrics. I talk to myself when I’m nervous and laugh at my own jokes. I’m a mix of introvert and dreamer, always imagining what’s possible.</p>

    <p>My dream is simple yet profound: to be successful and financially stable so I can give back to my family. I want my siblings to look up to me, to see that with perseverance and love, anything is possible. I want to be a living reminder that even when life gets tough, rising slowly is still rising, and trying—even when it’s scary—is still a step forward.</p>

    <div class="quote">
      “No matter how hard life gets, never give up. Rise, even if it’s slow. Try, even if it’s scary. Every step forward is a step toward the life you deserve.”

      Still unfolding. Still dancing. Still dreaming. Forever remembering.
